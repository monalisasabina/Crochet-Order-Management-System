---

## Installation

### Requirements

- **Node.js:** Version 20.9 or later (current LTS/latest recommended)
- **Package Manager:** npm, Yarn, pnpm, or Bun
- **Conceptual Knowledge:** Basic understanding of JavaScript and React

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd crochet-order-management-system
```

2. **Install dependencies for frontend and backend**
```bash
#Frontend
cd Client
npm install

# Backend
cd Server
npm install
```

3. **Run the application**
```bash
# Start backend
cd Server
npm run dev

# Start frontend
cd Client
PORT=4000 npm run dev
```
``` PORT=4000 npm run dev``` is to avoid conflicts when running on the frontend and backend on the two different terminal.

4. **Access the app**
- Frontend: ```http://localhost:4000```

- Backend API: ```http://localhost:3000```

### Usage
1. Open the app in your browser.

2. Navigate to the client list to view or search for clients.

3. Create new orders via the "New Order" section.

4. Update order status or details as needed.

5. View past and ongoing orders in a structured interface.


## Configuration
### - Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the server directory to configure backend options:
```bash
PORT=4000
DATABASE_URL=<your-database-url>
```
### - Frontend Configuration:
Update API endpoint URLs in the frontend .env.local file if different from defaults.


## Troubleshooting
#### - Frontend does not start:
Ensure you are in the client directory and all dependencies are installed.

#### Backend API errors:
Check .env configuration and ensure the database is running.

#### Port conflicts:
Make sure the ports 3000 (frontend) and 5000 (backend) are free.

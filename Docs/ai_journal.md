## 1. Step 1: Next.js Installation

```text
I want to do a Next.js application. I'm conversant with React.js for frontend and Python for Backend. So i have the following questions for you? 1. what are the systems requirements? 2. Is Next.js installed the same way as React.js? 3. I'm thinking of structuring the project root folder to have a client and server folder for frontend and backend respectively, is it recommended to do so?

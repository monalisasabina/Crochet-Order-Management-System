## 1. Title & Objective
### CROCHET ORDER  MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

I will be using Next.js for this project. I selected it out of curiosity. I'd like to know what the actual difference is between React.js and Next.js, and why most job postings I have seen want a developer with experience in Next.js. 

From my research online, what intrigued me is this statement: “Next.js is a popular React-based framework used in building web applications with the use of React components. Next.js provides additional structure, features, and optimization for your web application.” from freecodecamp.

Crochet is my hobby, and it is slowly turning out to be a side hustle. I get orders from friends and family. Recently, a relative asked me, “Where is the scarf you were to crochet for me?”…. Oops! So apparently, I had forgotten all about it since I hadn’t written it down. So with this application, I’m hoping I will be able to track down orders given, and I should be able to track them to know if I have finished them.

 

## 2. Quick Summary of the Technology
Next.js is a React framework used for building full-stack web applications. It was created by Vercel.
It is used in e-commerce platforms, marketing and corporate websites, the media industry, business services, and community-driven web apps.
Next.js has been used to build the official website of OpenAI. Through the website, the user is informed about the company's research, and they also inform the user about their products, ChatGPT and DALL-E.
